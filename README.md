# Simple Task Management System 


By using this project, you can create tasks and assign them to a specific user, with the ability to track whether the user has finished the task or not.


and you can create a team that holds a bunch of members, and you can assign them tasks within the team they are in.


and of course you can view all the tasks that you've made along with them (status, priority, date, and assigned user).


All of that can be done by the manager.



As a member:


You can view all the tasks that have been assigned to you, and you can only edit the status of the task to (completed or not completed) and vice versa.


and you can see the team that you've been assigned to by your manager.


As an owner:


You have full permission to use the websites, along with the dashboard page that provides statistics about website activities and charts.
